Klever Global is a sole-proprietorship incorporated in Hamburg, Germany and is the brainchild of Marc Riepen.

Marc Riepen is a well-known personality in the performance-marketing business, and has been actively managing & optimizing campaigns for clients, since 2004.

Marc is the CEO behind Klever and assembled a select team of Industry Veterans who have been working together for almost as long, as Klever does Business.

The A-Team as we like to humorously call us internally, consists of programmers as well as marketing professionals.
Klever has no office space, and works entirely remote. We would like to say that we've invented  distributed workspaces & async communication, but this honor goes to [Matt Mullenweg and Wordpress](https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/), which also operates entirely remote.

## Why The Name "Klever"?
**/ˈklevə(r)/** is phonetics for the english word "clever", but coincidentally the German equivalent is written almost exactly like that, "Klever". So we thought this was, well, kinda clever... :)
